   <p>This will be an odd post for a tech blog. But here is a list of names "too on-the-nose":</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Kenneth Chesebro</strong> — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Chesebro">Guy</a> from Wisconsin who came up with the alternative electors idea to try to confuse the 2020 elections so the House could throw it to Trump. He seems like a pretty cheesy bro to me.</li>
    <li><strong>Bernie Madoff</strong> — He <em>made off</em> with the money.</li>
    <li><strong>Terra Rodgers</strong> — a "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/02/geothermal-energy-electricity">director for superhot rock energy</a>", that is a form of geothermal energy, a kind of <em>terrestrial</em> energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Yahya Sinwar</strong> — Whatever you think of the broader Israel/Palestine conflict, the operation he ordered on October 7, 2023 was <em>sin</em> and guaranteed a brutal <em>war</em>. That <em>Sinwar</em> is preceded by <em>Yahya</em> renders the name a kind of Satanic cheerleader's chant.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>More names coming soon!</p>
   <p>I've kind of wanted to maintain a list like this for a long time. I sometimes think we're inhabiting a work of fiction, given how contrivedly <em>a propos</em> certain names often are. I encounter these names, and I want to make a note of them.</p>
   <p>I'll do that here!</p>
   <p>(I think I might once have encountered a Twitter thread in this vein. My apologies to whomever I am ripping off!)</p>
   <p>Please get in touch with any suggestions!</p>
   <p><em><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://artlung.com/">Joe Crawford</a> writes to point out that the on-the-nosedness of names <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180404-do-our-names-push-us-toward-certain-jobs">might have mechanisms</a> other than the universe being a crude dissimulation!</em></p>

   <p>Anyway, I'm finally putting together this list here, on my "tech blog", because it's a good way to experiment with an idea that Chris Krycho <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/essays/feeds-are-not-fit-for-gardening/">describes</a> as "sprouts".</p>
   <p>Often "posts" ought not be thought of as finished pieces, but as beginnings — seeds, even — of ongoing, evolving work. (Thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@erlend@writing.exchange">Erlend Sogge Heggen</a> for pointing me to this piece!)</p>
   <p>I've begun by adding support to the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt"><code>&lt;atom:updated&gt;</code> tag</a> in my site generator's RSS.</p>
   <p>When I make meaningful changes, I can update this value, and my feed will re-sort the updated post to the top, and prefix "Updated:" to the title. I can optionally mark posts to create a new GUID for each update, which may cause tools (like my own <a href="https://tech.interfluidity.com/2024/01/29/feedletter-tutorial/index.html">feedletter</a>) to treat them as new posts.</p>
   <p>(For now, I am leaving that turned off for this post, and just re-sorting updates to the top of the feed. In the future, who knows?)</p>
   <p>There's lots, lots more to explore in this vein. Do read <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/essays/feeds-are-not-fit-for-gardening/">Chris Krycho's post</a>. But this, I hope, is a start.</p>
