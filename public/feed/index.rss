  <p>A couple of years ago, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/swaldman/fossilphant">fossilphant</a>, a utility for converting exported archives of Mastodon accounts into readable, self-hostable static sites. You can see what those look like <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/microblog-archives/fosstodon">here</a> or <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/microblog-archives/econtwitter">here</a> or <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/microblog-archives/zirkus">here</a>. (I've wandered across three “instances” on Mastodon!)</p>
  <p>Now you can turn your Bluesky <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/repo-export"><code>repo.car</code></a> file into a static site as well! Here's how!</p>
  <ol>
   <li data-list-item-id="e5557116a631e7643925e3c6f0716d4bc">Install <a href="https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/"><code>scala-cli</code></a>. It's <a href="https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install">very easy</a>!</li>
   <li data-list-item-id="eb7ecdd593e7f698322cac465badde060">
    <p>Download two scripts, <a href="https://github.com/swaldman/fossilphant/releases/download/v0.1.0/download-bluesky-images"><code>download-bluesky-images</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/swaldman/fossilphant/releases/download/v0.1.0/fossilphant-bluesky"><code>fossilphant-bluesky</code></a>. (To be sure you are using the latest version, you can download them <a href="https://github.com/swaldman/fossilphant/releases">directly from github</a>.)</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Make the scripts executable:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-plaintext">% chmod +x download-bluesky-images
% chmod +x fossilphant-bluesky</code></pre>
    <p>Try <code>./download-bluesky-images --help</code> and <code>./fossilphant-bluesky --help</code> to get a sense of the many options you won't need to use.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <i>The first time you hit these scripts, they will download a bunch of stuff. That will only happen once.</i></p>
   </li>
   <li data-list-item-id="e679a976f8825c142b3725982466155a7">Download your <code>repo.car</code> file. In Bluesky go to <code>Settings &gt;Account &gt; Export my data</code>.</li>
   <li data-list-item-id="e52aae9ff38b391d8d8ae45065ea08bce">
    <p>Download you images into an images directory:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-plaintext">% ./download-bluesky-images --repo repo.car --output images</code></pre>
    <p>That may take a minute. When its done, you'll have a lot of images. Check out:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-plaintext">% ls images</code></pre>
   </li>
   <li data-list-item-id="e9ea9f007c89e518a26e74b0a48207311">
    <p>Now, build your static site!</p>
    <pre><code class="language-plaintext">% ./fossilphant-bluesky --handle=interfluidity.com --images=images repo.car</code></pre>
    <p>Note that you have to provide the DNS handle that you use for your Bluesky account. Your archive does not include this, just your <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/did">AT-proto "did"</a> ("decentralized identifier").</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>You'll find a directory called <code>public</code> has now appeared. Open its <code>index.html</code> file and behold!</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>You can take a peek at my archive <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/microblog-archives/bluesky/">here</a>. That's it!</p>

      <title>Using Tailscale to proxy traffic to the US</title>

   <p>I'm traveling, and found that some sites I needed to access forbid traffic from my location. In order to, like, pay a utility bill and renew some insurance, I needed my requests to appear to be coming from the United States.</p>
   <p>Obviously, the easy thing would be just be to install one of a zillion VPNs that would let one do this. But they usually involve some subscription fee, this is a rare issue for me and I'm cheap, and I've been curious about <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>, which has a free personal-use tier.</p>
   <p>Anyway, here's what I did:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>Download the Tailscale app on my Mac (from the app store)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Run the app</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Authenticate (I chose Apple as authentication provider) and give Tailscale VPN permissions</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Install Tailscale on a US-based linux machine</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>Check the linux version I'm running</p>
       <ul>
        <li>I know it's a Debian, so <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/177205/how-do-i-know-which-version-of-debian-im-running">run</a> <code>cat /etc/*-release</code></li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>I'm skittish about <code>curl -fsSL whatever | sh</code> style installations, which Tailscale <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1031/install-linux">first suggests</a> for linux, so I ran (the not all that much safer) <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1187/install-ubuntu-2204">version-specific Tailscale installation</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>The <code>sudo apt-get</code> commands installed a new kernel. I rebooted after this part of the installation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>Running <code>tailscale up</code> prints an authetication URL and then hangs. I copy the URL, then authenticate the Linux machine from my Mac laptop, by pasting it into my browser.</p>
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Enable IP forwarding for Tailscale, see <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes?tab=linux">the docs</a></p>
     <ul>
      <li>For me this was the following, but do read the docs, it's system dependent:
       <pre><code class="language-plaintext">% echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
% echo 'net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
% sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf   
</code></pre></li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Allow my linux box to become an exit node with <code>tailscale up --advertise-exit-node</code></p>
     <ul>
      <li>Note there was no need to do a <code>tailscale down</code> before rerunning <code>tailscale up</code> with the <code>--advertise-exit-node</code> flag</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>On my <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines">Tailscale dashboard</a> (link will only work when you're authenticated into Tailscale) my linux box is visitable and is marked as a potential exit node. Click "..." in the entry for the linux box, then "Edit route settings...", and check "Use as exit node."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>In the Tailscale menu visible in the Mac menu bar when Tailscale is running, go to the "Exit Nodes" submenu, then select the linux box</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Traffic is now being proxied through the US-located linux machine</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Since I don't want (for now) to use Tailscale all the time, I turn Tailscale off:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>On the linux box <code>tailscale down</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>On the Mac, via the Tailscale menu, reset the exit node to "None"</p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>Turn the green "Connected" switch to gray "Not Connected"</p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>Via the Tailscale menu again, quit the Tailscale app</p>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>Hopefully now I am back to ordinary networking.</p>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>I think (hope) that at any time, I can rerun the Tailscale app on my Mac, restore the "Not Connected" switch to "Connected", rerun <code>tailscale up --advertise-exit-node</code> on the linux box, then continue from Step 7 above.</p>
   <p>On linux <code>tailscale status</code> will tell you whether <code>tailscale</code> is running. I reboot and check, to ensure Tailscale is not set to start-up on boot.</p>

      <title>Zero-ish overhead logging facade in Scala 3</title>
      <dc:creator><![CDATA[Steve Randy Waldman]]></dc:creator>

   <p>The JVM has a lot of logging libraries. There's the built-in <code>java.util.logging</code> package, the venerable log4j project (now <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html">log4j2</a>), <a href="https://logback.qos.ch/">logback</a>, Scala-specific libraries like <a href="https://github.com/outr/scribe">scribe</a>, etc.</p>
   <p>As a library author, I've long been partial to logging facades, where you write to one API, and can choose which among the multiple "backends" will log the messages.</p>
   <p>The idea was pioneered by <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/">Apache Commons Logging</a>. <a href="https://www.slf4j.org/">slf4j</a> is I think the most popular logging facade these days. I long ago wrote my own facade, <code>mlog</code>, initially in support of the <a href="https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#configuring_logging">c3p0</a> library, but I've used it for many, many projects. I've also <a href="https://github.com/swaldman/mlog-scala">wrapped it beneath</a> a concise Scala API that I really like.</p>
   <p>JVM logging facades, if written with care, are quite performant in practice. They are not a meaningful bottleneck. Nevertheless, there is a bit of overhead. You call the facade API, bytecode is generated for those calls, which then transform inputs and forward them to a logging library.</p>
   <p>I've been intrigued for a while by the possibility in Scala 3 of writing logging facades that eliminate this small bit of overhead. Scala 3 has a souped up <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/macros/inline.html">inline</a> <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/metaprogramming/inline.html">functionality</a>, by which facade API calls can be transfomed into back-end API calls at compile-time, eliminating any facade overhead at runtime.</p>
   <p>I'm building a bunch of "daemon"-style services now, for which logging will be important, so it seemed like a good time to give this a try. The result is called <a href="https://github.com/swaldman/logadapter-scala"><code>LogAdapter</code></a>.</p>
   <p>The logging API style I developed for <code>mlog-scala</code>, which I am very happy with, is to call <code>log</code> methods directly on logging levels. The messages get routed to "loggers" determined by context (more specifically, by what Scala <code>given</code> or <code>implicit</code> values are in scope). For example, I might call:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-scala">SEVERE.log("This is bad.")
</code></pre>
   <p><code>SEVERE</code> is a logging level defined in my <code>logadapter</code> package, but which is not defined in <code>log4j</code>, the backend I am using.</p>
   <p>Although it looks like I'm calling a method on <code>SEVERE</code>, there is no sign of such a method in the generated bytecode:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">     236: aload_0
     237: invokevirtual #103                // Method logAdapter:()Llogadapter/log4j2/LogAdapter;
     240: astore        22
     242: aload         22
     244: astore        23
     246: aload         23
     248: invokevirtual #107                // Method logadapter/log4j2/LogAdapter.logger:()Lorg/apache/logging/log4j/Logger;
     251: astore        24
     253: getstatic     #113                // Field org/apache/logging/log4j/Level.ERROR:Lorg/apache/logging/log4j/Level;
     256: astore        25
     258: aload         24
     260: aload         25
     262: invokeinterface #119,  2          // InterfaceMethod org/apache/logging/log4j/Logger.isEnabled:(Lorg/apache/logging/log4j/Level;)Z
     267: ifeq          284
     270: aload         24
     272: aload         25
     274: ldc           #138                // String This is bad.
     276: invokeinterface #125,  3          // InterfaceMethod org/apache/logging/log4j/Logger.log:(Lorg/apache/logging/log4j/Level;Ljava/lang/String;)V
</code></pre>
   <p>The bit of bytecode referencing <code>logadapter</code> constructs is just a field lookup, which would be necessary even using the logging libraries directly. (Typically logging libraries reference a "logger" cached as a field of an object.) The field lookup is nested behind two accessors, it's like <code>this.logAdapter().logger()</code>.</p>
   <p>While in Java, accessing a logger might mean accessing a <code>static</code> field directly, in Scala, even using the native libraries, the field lookup would be behind an accessor. So the only additional overhead is the second, inner accessor call. Using a back-end library directly might provoke only a single hit to an accessor. But the cost of the additional accessor call is negligible.</p>
   <p>(And, a bit overzealously, the library actually economizes accessor calls on the backend by caching in ways typical library users do not. Note that <code>logger</code> and <code>Level.ERROR</code> are looked up once, rather than twice, in the bytecode above, although they are ultimately referred to twice, as in the code snippet below. These accessor calls are likely optimized away by modern JVMs at runtime anyway.)</p>
   <p>Beyond looking up the logger, the bytecode refers only to construct of the backend library, <code>org.apache.logging.log4j</code> constructs in this case. There is no method call on a <code>logadapter.Level</code>. There are method calls on an <code>org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger</code> supplying an <code>org.apache.logging.log4j.Level</code> as arguments.</p>
   <p>It's exactly as if we'd called the following methods directly on the <code>log4j2</code> library (referencing that library's <code>Level.ERROR</code>, since it does not support a level <code>SEVERE</code>):</p>
   <pre><code class="language-scala">import org.apache.logging.log4j.*

if logger.isEnabled( Level.ERROR ) then logger.log( Level.ERROR, "This is bad." )
</code></pre>
   <p>Again, since logging facades are not really a performance bottleneck, there's not any spectacular improvement over using <code>mlog</code>. In informal testing of just the facade — that is, excluding the cost of actual logging, by sending messages at levels below the loggable threshold — I see a roughly 25% improvement using this resolved-at-compile-time facade over resolved-at-runtime <code>mlog</code>. In practice, the improvement would be even less, because many calls will hit logging IO (or add requests for logging IO to an asynchronous queue), rendering the facades, static and dynamic, a smaller part of the overhead.</p>
   <p>Of course one of the benefits of facades — a reason why library authors often choose them! — is precisely because which backend gets hit can be resolved at runtime. If your library will be used as part of a larger application, it's nice if it can be configured to log to the same backend that the larger application will, without having to modify and recompile library code.</p>
   <p>But the logadapter facade is so thin, there's very little cost to using it even if its "backend" will be a runtime-configurable facade like <code>slf4j</code> or <code>mlog</code>.</p>
   <p>And for most applications, it's fine for the logging backend to be chosen at compile time. In which case the (small) runtime performance hit of a facade can be circumvented almost entirely.</p>
   <p><a href="https://github.com/swaldman/logadapter-scala"><code>LogAdapter</code></a> is much simpler and smaller than traditional logging facades, and can be layered on top of them at low cost where that makes sense. I think it will be a pretty good foundation for logging.</p>

   <p>(See "Rock the JVM" for a <a href="https://rockthejvm.com/articles/scala-3-inlines">quick explainer</a>.)</p>

   <pre><code class="language-scala">object InlineImplicitOrdering:

  object LocalContext:
    given Int = 22

    def printItLocally : Unit = printIt

  @main
  def go() =
    printIt
    LocalContext.printItLocally
</code></pre>
   <p>It's straightforward that calling <code>printIt</code> prints <code>10</code>.</p>
   <p>It's not so straightforward what <code>LocalContext.printItLocally</code> will do.</p>
   <p>Implicit resolution is also a compile-time operation. If implicit resolution happens before the inlining, then <code>LocalContext.printItLocally</code> might print <code>10</code>. If implicit resolution happens after the inlining is resolved, then <code>LocalContext.printItLocally</code> should print <code>22</code>.</p>
   <p>In reality, it prints <code>22</code>.</p>
   <p>The output of this program is</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">10
22
</code></pre>
   <p>I wondered whether this would always be the case, or whether adding modifiers might change this ordering. In particular I know that it's possible to declare <code>inline given</code>, rather than straight <code>given</code>, and I wondered whether this might cause the <code>printIt</code> function to collapse to <code>println(10)</code>.</p>
   <p>The answer is no. As far as I can tell, there is no set of modifiers that would cause the implicit resolution to occur before the final inlining. Neither <code>inline given</code>, nor <code>transparent inline given</code>, nor marking the implicit argument <code>inline</code> has this effect.</p>
   <p>As far as I can tell, the hard and fast rule is that inline resolution is completed prior to any implicit resolution. Implicits will be resolved at the ultimate, inlined call site, and never before.</p>
   <p>Which is the behavior I find that I want! I am glad it does not seem to be fragile.</p>
   <p>(I'd still like to understand what <code>inline given</code> is for, though.)</p>

   <p><strong>TL; DR:</strong> DeepSeek-R1-14B seems pretty "smart". For tasks that, um, don't involve syllable counting, it might be sophisticated enough to be useful. (Or not! It'd take more experimentation to decide.)</p>
   <p>But it runs too slowly on my 5-year-old Intel-based MacBookPro, even tricked out with 64GB of RAM. Smaller models run with better performance, but the result quality is likely too poor to be useful. For whatever I do with LLMs, I'm afraid I'm stuck with the online services for now.</p>
   <hr>
   <p>In the <a href="https://tech.interfluidity.com/2025/01/28/baby-deepseek-on-on-mac-laptop/index.html">previous post</a> I ran the "baby" <a href="https://www.deepseek.com/">DeepSeek</a> generative AI model on my Mac laptop.</p>
   <p>(For instructions on how I installed <code>ollama</code>, and information about its basic use, see that <a href="https://tech.interfluidity.com/2025/01/28/baby-deepseek-on-on-mac-laptop/index.html">previous post</a> and its postscript.)</p>
   <p>The model ran fine, used a lot of CPU but not a lot of memory, generated output at a reasonable pace. Unfortunately, that model is not so "smart". It tells you how it's thinking, and it's not thinking very well. It misunderstands simple things and draws poor inferences.</p>
   <p>So now I've decided to try out a still small but bigger, less toy-ish model. The baby model had 1.5B parameters. This one has 14B, so almost 10 times as big.</p>
   <p>Downloading the model was trivial with <code>ollama</code>:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">% ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b
</code></pre>
   <p>It's actually a bit less 10 times as big as the baby model, which was about 1GB. Presumably there's some shared, fixed infrastructure, beyond the parameters. (I'm storage constrained, so I'm not retaining models in <code>~/.ollama</code>, there's just the one model there.)</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">% du -sh ~/.ollama
8.4G	/Users/swaldman/.ollama
</code></pre>
   <p>Running the model was also trivial:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">% ollama run deepseek-r1:14b
&gt;&gt;&gt; Send a message (/? for help)
</code></pre>
   <p>I first tried the same prompt as yesterday, "Write a 'Hello, world!' haiku."</p>
   <p>The model did run, but...</p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>It ran very, very slowly. The "baby" model ran quite briskly on my laptop. The 14B-parameter version ran like syrup.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>The compute load was similar (5-6 full cores saturated), but this model also occupied ~10GB of memory when running. The 1.5B-parameter version used too little memory for me to notice or care.</p>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>The 1.5B-parameter model failed to generate a haiku before I grew frustrated and quit it. The 14B-parameter also ultimately failed.</p>
   <p>I think I chose a hard "Hello, world!" prompt for all of these models! Haikus are defined by lines with set numbers of syllables. The 1.5B-parameter model mistook letters for syllables. The 14B parameter mostly (but not always!) correctly identified syllables, but often miscounted them.</p>
   <p>Even though it too ultimately went 'round and 'round until I interrupted it, the 14B-parameter model's <code>&lt;think&gt;...&lt;/think&gt;</code> process was much more relevant and coherent than the <a href="https://tech.interfluidity.com/2025/01/28/baby-deepseek-on-on-mac-laptop/index.html">1.5B-parameter model</a>:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">&gt;&gt;&gt; Write a 'Hello, world!' haiku.
&lt;think&gt;
Okay, so I need to write a 'Hello, world!' haiku. Hmm, I remember that a haiku is a traditional Japanese poem with three lines. The structure is usually 5 syllables in the first line, then 7 syllables in the second, and ending with another 5 syllables. 

Alright, so the theme here is "Hello, world!" which is pretty much about greeting the world or introducing oneself. I should think of imagery that represents a welcoming or introductory moment.

Let me brainstorm some words related to saying hello and the world. Maybe morning, sunrise, nature sounds like a good setting for a greeting. Dawn could symbolize a new beginning or a fresh start, which fits with saying hello to the world.

For the first line, I want something that captures attention and sets the scene. "Hello, gentle dawn" comes to mind. That's 5 syllables: He-ll-o, gen-tle, dawn. Yep, that works.

Next, the second line needs to be 7 syllables and connect with the first line while expanding on the theme. I want something that shows interaction or response from the world. Maybe "The world whispers back." Let's count: The -world-whis-pers-back. That's 5 syllables? Wait, no. Let me 
break it down.

"The" (1), "world" (2), "whis-pers" (3), "back" (4). Oh, only 4 syllables. Hmm, I need three more. Maybe rephrase it. How about "The world hums a welcome"? That's 6 syllables: The-world-hums-a-wel-come. Wait, that might be stretching it.

Alternatively, "The world greets me softly." Let's see: the (1), world (2), greets (3), me (4), soft-ly (5). No, still not 7. Maybe "The world responds with a smile." That's longer but syllables-wise: The (1), world (2), re-sponds (3), with (4), a (5), smile (6). Still only 6.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the action after the hello. Maybe something like "A new day begins." But that's more about the day starting. Alternatively, "Echoes of greeting fill the air." That's longer than 7 syllables though.

Hmm, perhaps "The world says hello too." Wait, let me count: The (1), world (2), says (3), hel-lo (4), too (5). No, that's only 5. I need two more syllables. Maybe "The world hums in reply." That's He-world-hums-in-reply. Let me break it down: the (1), world (2), hums (3), in (4), re ply 
(5 and 6). Wait, no, that's only 6.

Wait, maybe I can use "The world answers back." The (1), world (2), an-sers (3), back (4). That's 4 syllables. Not enough. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about nature sounds. Maybe "Birds sing in reply." That's 7 syllables: Birds (2), sing (1), in (1), reply (2). Wait, that doesn't add up. Let me count each word as syllables:

"Birds" - 1
"sing" - 1
"in" -1
"reply" -2

Total: 5. Not enough.

Wait, perhaps "Birdsong answers back." That's 7 syllables: Bird-song (2), an-swers (2), back (1). Wait, no:

"Birdsong" is two syllables, "answers" is two, "back" is one. Total 5 again.

I'm getting stuck on the second line. Maybe I should think of something else. How about a sunrise? "Sunrise breaks the silence." That's 7 syllables: Sun-rise (2), breaks (1), the (1), si-lence (2). Wait, that adds up to 6 syllables.

Wait, no: Sunrise is two, breaks is one, the is one, silence is two. Total 6. Hmm.

Alternatively, "Gentle breeze returns." That's 7? Gentle (2), breeze (1), re-turns (2). Wait, gentle is two syllables, breeze is one, returns is two: total 5.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the second line can be about reaching out or communication. "I reach out to you." That's 6 syllables: I (1), rea-ech (2), out (1), to (1), you (1). No, that's only 5.

Wait, maybe "I send a greeting far and wide." That's way too long. Let me think about natural elements again. Maybe water? "Waves whisper hello." That's waves (1), whisper (2), hel-lo (2). Wait: waves (1), whisper (2), hello (2). Total 5 syllables, but I need 7.

Alternatively, "Ripples greet the shore." Ripples (2), greet (1), the (1), shore (1). That's 5 again.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look back at the first line: "Hello, gentle dawn." Maybe the second line can continue that imagery. Dawn brings light, so perhaps something like "Light breaks the silence." That's 6 syllables: Light (1), breaks (1), the (1), si-lence (2). Total 5 again.

Wait, maybe "Dawn greets the morning sky." That's dawn (1), greets (1), the (1), morn-ing (2), sky (1). Total is 6 syllables. Hmm.

Alternatively, "A new day starts with a smile." New (1), day (1), starts (1), with (1), a (1), smile (1). That's 6.

I'm still not hitting that 7-syllable mark for the second line. Maybe I should try something else. How about focusing on the feeling of greeting? "Heart beats in rhythm." Heart (1), beats (1), in (1), rhyth-m (2). Total is 5.

Wait, maybe "Echoes fill the air." Echoes (2), fill (1), the^C
</code></pre>
   <p>As before, my next step was to see if the model could code a simple "Hello, world!" program in Scala. The 1.5B-parameter model failed abysmally. Even when presented with compiler errors, and then my suggestions to tutor it, it was not making progress towards a correct solution.</p>
   <p>The 14B parameter produced a correct program on its first attempt. It's <code>&lt;think&gt;...&lt;/think&gt;</code>-ing was not perfect, but was mostly pretty good.</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">&gt;&gt;&gt; Please write a Scala program that prints "Hello, world!"
&lt;think&gt;
Okay, I need to write a Scala program that prints "Hello, world!". Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that in Scala, you can print something using the println function. So maybe I just call println("Hello, world!")?

Wait, but how does aScala script work? Do I need to have an object or is it simpler than that? Oh right, for a simple program like this, I think you can just write it in a single line. But wait, when compiling with scalac, do I need to structure it as an object?

Let me think. If I'm writing a script, maybe I can use the main method inside an object. So perhaps the code should be something like:

object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, world!")
  }
}

Yes, that makes sense. Because when you run a Scala program, it looks for an object with a main method. So this structure is correct.

Alternatively, I remember that in older versions of Scala, you could just write the code without defining an object if using the scalaz script compiler or something like that. But perhaps the more standard way is to define an object with the main method.

So putting it all together, the code should be an object named HelloWorld (or any name really), and inside the main function, we call println with the desired string.

Let me double-check: When I run this program, either by compiling with scalac and then running with scala, or using a Scala IDE, it should print "Hello, world!" correctly. Yeah, that should work.
&lt;/think&gt;

To write a Scala program that prints "Hello, world!", follow these steps:

1. **Create a new file** for your Scala program. It can be named `HelloWorld.scala`.

2. **Write the code**: The code will define an object with a main method that calls `println` to output the desired message.

Here's the complete Scala code:

```scala
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, world!")
  }
}
``` 

3. **Run the program**:
   - **Using the command line**:
     - Compile the file using `scalac HelloWorld.scala`.
     - Run it with ` scala HelloWorld`.
   - **Using an IDE**: Simply run the script through your preferred Scala IDE.

This program will output:

``` 
Hello, world!
```

&lt;think&gt;
Alright, so the user just thanked me for the previous explanation on writing a "Hello, world!" program in Scala. They were probably satisfied with the answer, but I should think about how to respond appropriately. 

I want to be polite and encouraging, so I'll acknowledge their gratitude. Maybe add an emoji to keep it friendly. Also, since they might be new to programming orScala, offering further help is a good idea. I can ask if there's anything else they need assistance with.

Hmm, perhaps I should also provide options for what they might want next—like solving another problem or explaining more concepts. That way, it shows I'm ready to assist them in various ways.

I should keep the response concise and positive, making sure they feel comfortable asking more questions if needed.
&lt;/think&gt;

You're welcome! If you have any other questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask! 😊

The trendy AI-ready GPU-endowed servers some cloud providers are renting are way beyond my price point.</p>
   <p>So, for now, I think I'm stuck with the megafirms, to the degree that I use this stuff at all. But the DeepSeek models are a big step closer towards LLMs more consistent with our independence, and I'm grateful for that.</p>

   <p>That last line is prompting me for a prompt.</p>
   <p>When I run prompts, I find that the model does not stress out my memory at all, but does use up 5 to 6 cores of CPU while it is active.</p>
   <p>For the purpose of this post, I tried what I thought would be a simple prompt:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">&gt;&gt;&gt; Write a 'Hello, world!' haiku.
</code></pre>
   <p>The model generates a <code>&lt;think&gt;...&lt;/think&gt;</code> section in which it describes its own "thought" process. But it is so neurotic! Endearingly neurotic! It went around in circles. I eventually grew impatient and aborted it with <code>&lt;ctrl-c&gt;</code>.</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">&lt;think&gt;
Okay, so I need to write a haiku in lowercase for "Hello, world!" that reads backwards both in the traditional way and when reversed again. Let me start by recalling what a haiku is. It's a three-line poem where the first line has five characters, the second eight, and the third five, 
all in iambic pentameter.

First, I'll break down "Hello, world!". The words are H, E, L, L, O, ,, W, O, R, L, D. But since we're writing it in lowercase as "hello, world!", that's h e l l o , w o r l d. Now, for the haiku structure, I need to arrange these into three lines with specific syllable counts and stress 
patterns.

The first line should have five syllables. So I'll pick a part of "hello" that has five letters, counting each vowel as one syllable. H-e-l-ll-o is 1+1+2+2+1=7 syllables. Hmm, too many. Maybe h-e-llo would be better—h (1) + e (1) + l (1) + l (1) + o (1) = 5 syllables.

Wait, but "hello" is H E L L O, so five letters with four consonants and one vowel. So that's correct for the first line: h-e-l-l-o.

Now, I need to make it into a haiku. The second line should have eight syllables, and the third line back to five again. Also, when reversed in both ways, they should form "hello, world!" correctly.

Let me think about how to mirror "hello" in some way. Maybe using symmetrical patterns or mirrors. Alternatively, considering the punctuation: comma and exclamation mark. The second word is a bit tricky with the comma—perhaps that's intentional as part of the haiku structure.

Looking at "hello", the next word after the first line would be two syllables for eight in total, but including the comma it might need to be longer. Maybe h-e-ll-o-, which has four letters plus the comma. That could work: h-e-l-l-o- (four characters) and then another line.

Wait, let me try that. First line: h-e-l-l-o—5 syllables. Second line: h-e-llo- (but wait, h-e-l-l-o is five letters; maybe I'm overcomplicating). Alternatively, the second word could be "ll" with a hyphen or something? But in haikus, usually words are separated by spaces.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the syllables. The first line: 1+1+2+2+1=7 syllables—need to adjust to 5. So maybe h-e-l-l-o is correct as five letters, but I need to represent it with five syllables in a four-letter base? Or perhaps use an alliteration.

Alternatively, think about "hello" and mirror the words somehow. Maybe H-e-llo-world? But that's eight letters for two lines and five again. Wait, no—haiku is three lines: 5-8-5.

So first line: h-e-l-l-o (h + e + l + l + o = 5 syllables). Second line needs to have eight syllables. Maybe h-e-ll-o-w (but that's only seven letters; maybe with an exclamation or hyphen? Alternatively, think of the second word as a two-syllable word but longer in terms of letters.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to mirror "hello" around the center. So H E L L O would be mirrored as D O L L E, but that doesn't fit into the haiku structure. Alternatively, think of it in a way where each word relates somehow.

Alternatively, consider that the second line is a contraction or reflection. Maybe h-e-ll-o-, then w-o-r-l-d. But I'm not sure about the syllables here. Let me count:

First line: h-e-l-l-o → 5 syllables.
Second line: h-e-llo-w (h + e + l + l + o + w → six letters, which is more than eight; maybe this approach isn't right.)

Alternatively, perhaps using alliteration or a more specific pattern. Let me think of "hello" and how it can be mirrored with the second word being two syllables but having more letters.

Wait, another approach: The first line is 5 syllables (h-e-l-l-o), then for eight, maybe h-e-ll-o-w (but that's six characters; perhaps including a hyphen or something). Alternatively, think of "hello" and "world" as related in some way, like the second word being two syllables but 
longer.

Wait, let me consider "h-e-llo-world"—but no, it would be 12 letters. Maybe h-e-ll-o-w (but I'm getting confused with syllable counts).

Alternatively, perhaps think of each word as having a certain number of stressed vowels or consonants. For example, in the second line, the stress pattern might require two stressed syllables.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for existing haikus and see if any are similar to "hello" that can be mirrored. But since I'm supposed to create this from scratch, let me try again.

First line: h-e-l-l-o → 5 syllables.
Second line needs to have eight syllables. Maybe h-e-llo-w (h + e + l + l + o + w = six letters) but that's seven characters with an exclamation mark—maybe h-e-ll-o-w? Let me check the stress pattern for "hello". The word is h-e-l-l-o, which has four consonants and one vowel. So it 
sounds like a single syllable maybe.

Wait, no: 'Hello' has two syllables: H-e and llo, but in reality, it's pronounced as one syllable. But I need to make the haiku with five syllables for the first line.

Alternatively, perhaps h-e-ll-o would have four consonants, so that's 4 letters which is too few for a five-syllable word. Wait, no: h (1) + e (2) + l (3) + l (4) + o (5). So it's five syllables.

So first line: H E L L O → 5 syllables.

Second line needs to have eight syllables. Maybe h-e-ll-o-w? Let me check the syllable count for "hello, world": two lines of 5 and 8 respectively. Wait, no—the haiku is five, then eight, then five. But in this case, first line: hello (h-e-l-l-o) → five syllables.

Second line: h-e-ll-o-w? Let's see: h (1), e (2), l (3), l (4), o (5), w (6). That's six letters, which would be eight syllables if each word is broken down. Wait, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps "h-e-ll-o-w" as the second line but considering more syllables. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for existing haikus in the style of "hello, world!" and see how they mirror each other.

Wait, another idea: The second word is two syllables, so maybe h-e-ll-o-w? That's six letters but seven characters (including the comma). Alternatively, perhaps it's h-e-llo-w with a hyphen or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of "h-e-ll-o" as one line and then mirroring with "w-o-r-l-d" in reverse. So maybe h-e-ll-o-, w-o-rld? Let me check the syllables:

First line: h-e-l-l-o → five syllables.
Second line: h-e-ll-o-w (h + e + l + l + o + w = six letters) but that's seven characters with a comma. Maybe hyphenated or something else, but it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the second word is "h-e-llo", which is four syllables, and then "world" as two? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to write the lines step by step:

First line: h-e-l-l-o → 5 syllables.
Second line needs to be eight syllables. Maybe h-e-ll-o-w (six letters) but with a hyphen or something, making it seven characters. Alternatively, think of "h-e-ll-o-w" as the second word, which would make the entire line longer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to mirror the words somehow. So H-E-L-L-O could be mirrored around the center, perhaps h-e-llo-world, but that's too long.

Wait, another idea: The first line is 5 syllables, and the second word is two syllables with more letters. For example, h-e-ll-o (five letters) vs. w-o-r-l-d (but that would be in reverse). Alternatively, think of "h-e-ll-o" as one line and then "world" mirrored.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me try to write the second line as h-e-ll-o-w with a hyphen or something, making it 6 characters. But no, haikus have strict syllable counts.

Alternatively, think of each word in terms of syllables: first line is five, second is eight, third is five.

So second line needs to be eight syllables. Maybe h-e-llo-w (h + e + l + l + o + w = six letters) but that's seven characters. Alternatively, maybe "h-e-ll-o" and "w-d", making it two lines: h-e-ll-o- and w-o-rld? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to write the second line as h-e-llo-w with a hyphen in the middle or something, but^C

   <p>Then I tried a simpler variation:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">&gt;&gt;&gt; Write me a joyful greeting, please?
&lt;think&gt;
Okay, so I just received this message: "Write me a joyful greeting, please?" Hmm, that's interesting. At first glance, it sounds like someone is trying to ask for a greeting but maybe they don't realize how important it is. Let me try to unpack what's going on here.

So, the person wrote a greeting that ends with a question mark. That's a bit unusual because usually, greetings are polite and direct without any questions. Maybe they're testing something or just curious about why they're asking for this specific type of greeting. Perhaps they want to 
see if I can recognize different types of requests.

I should consider what kind of response they might expect. Since it ends with a question mark, maybe the next step is to acknowledge their request and provide a friendly reply. But how? A simple "Yes! Thank you for your kindness!" would be appropriate. It's concise and acknowledges their 
message without being repetitive or too formal.

I wonder if there are any underlying reasons behind their query. Maybe they're trying to get my attention quickly or set a context where I can respond further. Without more information, it's hard to say exactly what they need next, but focusing on a heartfelt greeting seems like the best 
approach right now.

Also, considering the tone, it should feel warm and caring. Using words that convey gratitude and appreciation is key here. Phrases like "I appreciate your kind words" or "Thank you for your kind gesture" can make the response more genuine.

Another angle to think about is the purpose of the greeting. If this is part of a larger conversation, maybe they need something specific for that context. But since I don't have any additional details, it's safer to keep it general and flexible.

I should also consider if there are alternative greetings that might be more suitable based on their message. For example, "How can I help you today?" or "Could you please let me know how I can assist you?" Each of these has its own merits, but the original question ends with a question 
mark, so focusing back on a simple, heartfelt response makes sense.

In summary, my approach should be to acknowledge their message, provide a genuine reply that shows appreciation, and keep it concise. This way, they know I'm listening without overcomplicating things.
&lt;/think&gt;

Certainly! Here's a heartfelt greeting in the requested format:

---

Hey there! I hope you're doing well today. It sounds like your kind words are always appreciated—thanks for taking the time to connect with me!

---

This response is warm, genuine, and acknowledges their message while keeping it concise.

   <p>A bit off. But not terrible!</p>
   <p>Next I tried to see if it could code:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">&gt;&gt;&gt; Please write a Scala program that prints "Hello, world!"
</code></pre>
   <p>This... didn't go so well.</p>
   <p>To be fair, Scala is not likely to be its most prominant training language, and some of its attempts could be excused as not quite knowing whether to write Scala 2 or Scala 3. Its first attempt was closer to Scala 3 than Scala 2. (It offered a naked top-level function, supported as <code>main</code> entry points only in Scala 3.) So I tried to tutor it towards s Scala 3 solution.</p>
   <p>It came pretty close! But after three or four back and forths over ~25 minutes, it still wasn't quite right and I gave up.</p>
   <p>This is the tiniest DeepSeek model. I wonder if I can run a bigger one, and if it performs a bit better?</p>
   <p>Stay tuned on that, I guess.</p>

   <p>In the BlueSky account you intend to syndicate to, go to Settings &gt; Privacy and security &gt; App passwords.</p>
   <p>Click "Add App Password".</p>
   <p>Give your app a name. We'll use "feedletter-syndication" again.</p>
   <p>Your app password will appear.</p>
   <p>Add a new line to <code>/etc/feedletter/feedletter-secrets.properties</code>, in the form <code>feedletter.bsky.identifier.&lt;identifier&gt;=&lt;app-password&gt;</code>.</p>
   <div class="note">
    <p>This is a bit different from Mastodon!</p>
    <p>In Mastodon, a totally arbitrary name went at the end of the key. Here it is the <em>user identifier</em>, which usually a DNS handle (but it can also be a <a href="https://atproto.com/">atproto</a> <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/did"><code>did</code></a>).</p>
   </div>
   <p>The account we're syndicating to will be <code>testable-bsky.bsky.social</code></p>

   <p>Postgres by default runs on port 5432, so let's add some database access and authentication information.</p>
   <p><code>feedletter</code> uses the <code>c3p0</code> connection pooling library.</p>
   <p>Edit <code>/etc/feedletter/feedletter-secrets.properties</code> so that it looks something like this:</p>

   <p><code>/etc/feedletter/feedletter-secrets.properties</code> should contain a "secret salt", whose value is entirely arbitrary but should be kept secret. We'll add that, so <code>/etc/feedletter/feedletter-secrets.properties</code> now looks like:</p>

   <p><code>feedletter</code> is general very cautious about announcing / e-mailing posts. Since posts are often edited soon after they are published, by default it waits a period of time, and then checks to make sure the post has been stable a while before announcing or e-mailing. By default <code>min-delay-minutes</code> is 30, <code>await-stabilization-minutes</code> is 15, <code>max-delay-minutes</code> is 180, and <code>recheck-every-minutes</code> is 10.</p>
   <p>It's probably best to use cautious settings like this, so you don't announce your links while you are still re-editing them. (I don't think I'm the only writer who inevitably finds important edits just after hitting publish.)</p>
   <p>For this tutorial, I'm going to use a feed of all the articles in my newsreader, <a href="https://www.inoreader.com">inoreader</a>. Its URL looks like</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p><code>https://www.inoreader.com/stream/user/0000000000/tag/all-articles</code>,</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>although <code>0000000000</code> is not in fact my user id, I'm altering that for privacy. You should use whatever feed you are interested in syndicating.</p>
   <p>To use the defaults, you could just type</p>
   <pre><code class="language-plaintext">$ ./feedletter add-feed https://www.inoreader.com/stream/user/0000000000/tag/all-articles
</code></pre>
   <p>For the purposes of our little experiment here, I want articles announced as soon as <code>feedletter</code> sees them, even if they have not "stabilized". For that, it will just be</p>

   <p><code>feedletter</code> is a layered application. First you tell it what feeds to watch, then you define different kinds of "subscribables" — e.g. email, Mastodon, BlueSky — to each of which multiple recipients can subscribe in order to receive notifications.</p>
   <p>Typically an e-mail subscribable will have many — 100s, 1000s — of destinations.</p>
   <p>BlueSky and Mastodon "subscribable" often have just one subscriber, the accounts to which entries will be syndicated. You can attach as many subscribers as you want, though, if you want to post announcements to many accounts.</p>

   <p>We saw the <code>feed-id</code> in the output to <code>./feedletter add-feed</code> (and if we forget it, we can always run <code>./feedletter list-feeds</code>).</p>

 Subscribe to a subscribable.
 
 Options and flags:
     --help
         Display this help text.
     --subscribable-name &lt;name&gt;
         The name of an already-defined subscribable.
     --e-mail &lt;address&gt;
         The e-mail address to subscribe.
     --display-name &lt;name&gt;
         A display name to wrap around the e-mail address.
     --sms &lt;number&gt;
         The number to which messages should be sent.
     --masto-instance-name &lt;name&gt;
         A private name for this Mastodon instance.
     --masto-instance-url &lt;url&gt;
         The URL of the Mastodon instance
     --bsky-identifier &lt;identifier&gt;
         An account identifier, usually a DNS name or value beginning with 'did:'.
     --bsky-entryway-url &lt;name&gt;
         The base URL of the bluesky service.
     --unconfirmed
         Mark the subscription unconfirmed.
</code></pre>
   <p>Recall that when we placed our Mastodon access token in <code>feedletter-secrets.properties</code>, we gave it a name. We chose "arbitrary-name", because it's lovely. That becomes our <code>masto-instance-name</code>. The URL of the instance that hosts our accounts will be <code>masto-instance-url</code>. So we just...</p>

</code></pre>
   <p>For BlueSky, at least for now, we don't really need to provide a URL, there's just one. (In the future, hopefully there will be more BlueSky-like <a href="https://atproto.com/">atproto</a> services, for which you would provide and <code>entryway-url</code>). All you need to provide is <code>bsky-identifier</code>, the DNS handle or <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/did"><code>did</code></a> associated with your BlueSky account.</p>

   <p>In English, a new item has been found, and it's been "assigned" to the various subscribables watching the feed, here one that distributes to mastodon, and another that distributes to Mastodon and another that distributes to BlueSky.

   <p>Some subscribables collect many posts before distributing them. (For example, a weekly digest e-mail.)</p>
   <p>But for Mastodon and BlueSky post announcements, each post should be distributed immediately following its observation. So soon after we see an add message, we'll see messages like...</p>

   <p>Once queued for distribution, you will see messages about postings to Mastodon and BlueSky.</p>
   <p>Since on very active feeds, you can get a lot of posts at once when they are republished, <code>feedletter</code> spaces postings to a single account by one minute (currently hardcoded, eventually configurable), though it sends its posting streams to all subscribed accounts in parallel.</p>

   <p><code>feedletter</code> will retry failed postings up to 10 times by default (the retry count is reconfigurable), then give up. This issue — the announcement is just too long to fit in BlueSky's 300 character limit — will not be cured, so that's what will happen. (I'll probably modify the BlueSky subscribable to just reject too-long posts, but for now they are just tried, retried, and eventually dropped.)</p>

   <p>That's it!</p>
   <p>It seems like a lot, but it's much easier done than said. Give it a try. It won't bite.</p>
   <p>It is also possible to customize the announcement messages that feedletter syndicates, or to include post text, length permitting. If that would be useful to you, <a href="mailto:swaldman@mchange.com">Let me know</a> and I'll add a quick tutorial on that.</p>

   <pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;
&lt;rss version="2.0" xmlns:iffy="http://tech.interfluidity.com/xml/iffy/" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"&gt;
  &lt;channel&gt;
    ...
    &lt;iffy:curation&gt;
      &lt;iffy:single/&gt;
    &lt;/iffy:curation&gt;
    &lt;iffy:completeness&gt;Content&lt;/iffy:completeness&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
</code></pre>
   <p>An ordinary syndicatin feed that includes curation and completeness metadata looks like this:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;
&lt;rss version="2.0" xmlns:iffy="http://tech.interfluidity.com/xml/iffy/" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"&gt;
  &lt;channel&gt;
    ...
    &lt;iffy:curation&gt;
      &lt;iffy:recent last="5"/&gt;
    &lt;/iffy:curation&gt;
    &lt;iffy:completeness&gt;Content&lt;/iffy:completeness&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
</code></pre>
   <p>All-item and single-item feeds, like syndication feeds, are discoverable in <code>&lt;link rel="alternate"&gt;</code> elements of the HTML pages of the blog.</p>
   <p>But they are not intended to be discovered by feed readers, which expect short feeds of recent posts for syndication. In order to prevent discovery of these feeds by feed readers, we give them special MIME type <em>in HTML link elements only</em>. These are still RSS feeds. Their "true" MIME type is still <code>application/rss+xml</code>.</p>
   <p>But in HTML link elements — only in HTML link elements — I use more specific, less standard MIME types, to throw unwitting feed readers off the scent. These MIME types are <code>application/x-all-item-rss+xml</code> and <code>application/x-single-item-rss+xml</code>.</p>
   <p>Here's the HTML link element to a site's all-item feed:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-html">  &lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/x-all-item-rss+xml" title="drafts.interfluidity.com - all items" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/all-item-feed/index.rss"&gt;
</code></pre>
   <p>Here's the HTML link element from a post permalink to that post's single-item feed:</p>
   <pre><code class="language-html">  &lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/x-single-item-rss+xml" title="Segmentation fault" href="index.rss"&gt;
</code></pre>
   <p>While ordinary feed readers should ignore these feeds, clients resolving <a href="https://tech.interfluidity.com/xml/iffy/index.html#iffy-item-ref"><code>iffy:item-ref</code></a> tags might find single-item and all-item feeds very useful.</p>
