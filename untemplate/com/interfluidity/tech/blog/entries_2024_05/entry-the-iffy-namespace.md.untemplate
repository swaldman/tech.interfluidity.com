I want to do a lot of things with RSS that require
extensions of RSS (as the RSS spec [foresees](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#extendingRss)).

The URL `http://tech.interfluidity.com/xml/iffy/` will mark an XML namespace in which some of these extensions will be defined.

The conventional prefix associated with this namespace will be `iffy`.

**The current version of this namespace is `v0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`.**

(`-SNAPSHOT` signifies that the version preceding that suffix has not yet been finalized. Much more to come!)

**Table of Contents**

* [`iffy:completeness`](#iffy-completeness)
* [`iffy:provenance`](#iffy-provenance)

<a id="iffy-completeness"></a>**Element &mdash; `iffy:completeness`**

<div class="iffy-element-desc">

**Solely a channel level element**

Contains one of the following four values:
1. `Ping`
2. `Metadata`
3. `Content`
4. `Media`

`iffy:completeness` describes the completeness that clients should expect of RSS [`item`](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#hrelementsOfLtitemgt) elements.

* `Ping` makes the least commitment. Items need not include a [`guid`](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt)
  element, or any elements at all beyond [RSS' requirement](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#hrelementsOfLtitemgt) that at least one of `title` or `description` be present.
  RSS documents have completion `Ping` by default. Any or all items may meet the requirement for a higher completeness level, but no promises or commitment is made
  beyond the base specification.
* `Metadata` commits that each item MUST include a [`guid`](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt) element,
  as well as meeting the base requirements for an RSS [`item`](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#hrelementsOfLtitemgt).
* `Content` commits that each item, either inside its `description` tag, or via an extension such as `content:encoded`, includes the full
  content of the items it includes, suitable for independent rendering by any client capable also of resolving references to linked media
  externally. No limitation is placed on whether the full content is placed in a `description` element, in `content:encoded`, or in
  some other extension.
* `Media` augments `Content` by _embedding attachments to subsidiary media_ inside the RSS document. Subsidiary media does not include
  all potential links, just links which share a prefix with the current RSS document, which by default means all links subsidiary to the parent
  of the RSS document as specified in an `atom:link`

  _More information on this soon when `iffy:attachment` is defined_

The four values represent nested, hierarchical levels of commitment. `Ping` commits to nothing more than the spec
requires. `Media` makes every commitment promised by the prior three levels, and an additional one.

If not specified, no commitment is made, the feed should be considered `Ping`.

**Example:**
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

<rss version="2.0" xmlns:iffy="http://tech.interfluidity.com/xml/iffy/" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">

<a id="iffy-provenance"></a>**Element &mdash; `iffy:provenance`**

<div class="iffy-element-desc">

**When an item level element**

If present in an item, the item contains a sequence of one or more [`atom:link`](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt) elements,
each of whose
* `rel` attribute is MUST BE `via`
* `href` attribute MUST BE the URL of an RSS feed from which the base contents of this item were drawn
* `type` attribute SHOULD BE `application/rss+xml`

If the item from which the current item was sourced does not contain an `iffy:provenance`, then the current
item should include just one `atom:link`.

If the item from which the current item was sourced _does_ contains an `iffy:provenance`, then the current
feed SHOULD include all items of that element, with the URL of the feed from which the item was sourced
PREPENDED.

This will ensure the most immediate source will be the first `atom:link` element. The origin &mdash; or at least
the source for which no further provenance is known &mdash; will be the last `atom:link` element.

Processors may expect a channel level `atom:link` element with `rel="self"` and `type="application/rss+xml"` to
use as the basis for provenance in source documents. See [RSS Best Practices](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-profile#namespace-elements-atom-link).
